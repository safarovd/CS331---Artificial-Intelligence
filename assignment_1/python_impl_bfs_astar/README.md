In order to run the program use this command:

python .\SearchAlgorithms.py start<num>.txt goal<num>.txt <bfs/astar> output.txt
  
This script was tested on local and the engr access servers. 

When executing the program responds with telling you what your command line arguments are and once a solution is found, the steps taken are printed to screen along with the number of nodes expanded and the path cost. If any issues occur, please let me know. Also, I've commented most of the syntax.
