# CS331---Artificial-Intelligence
Programming Assignments For CS 331

THIS PROJECT WAS WORKED ON BY TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFERENT PREFERENCES IN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES.
DFS and IDDFS are implemented in this current directory using C++


HOW TO USE:
In this current directory, type "make" without the quotes.

Typing make will clear the terminal and compile the program.

To run the program, type:

    make XY

where X = the algorithm ("dfs" or "iddfs" without the quotes)
and y = the test case number


Example:

    make dfs2

this runs the program on the second test case with dfs


If you wish to run valgrind, just add "val" without the quotes to the beginning

    make validdfs1
